**IN THE OCCULT WORLD**
**By MANOHAR KAUL**

My father gave me a pleasant smile and said, "It is too late in the day that you have asked this question." He added after a pause, "Had you enquired about it ten or fifteen years ago, I would have answered and you would have understood." I felt disappointed; with all my scepticism, I was so curious to know the reality. He had baffled all of us with certain happenings that I couldn't help wanting to probe into the realm of what one may call the occult, spiritual, or mysterious.

I knew my father well. He had led a pious life; mostly he would spend time reading books, and sit in meditation for long spells of time. But none of us paid any attention. He was left to himself and he would never bother or interfere in domestic matters. He virtually led a secluded life. This became more pronounced after his retirement. Materially, he was not successful but he was ever contented, with no regrets.

Once it so happened that at about 9.45 p.m., he came out from his room and entered the drawing room where my wife and children were playing cards. This was unusual as he would be sitting in meditation at that time. He looked at us with a grief-stricken face. There was pin-drop silence. He told us that his brother-in-law had passed away, just then at Srinagar. All of us broke into loud laughter. I said that we had received a letter from him only three days back; why should he die so suddenly? How could he say this while in Delhi? He became serious at our casualness and left the room without saying a word.

A day passed and the following night we had a telegram from Srinagar saying that the death of his brother-in-law had occurred the same day at the same time, i.e., 9.45 p.m.

We did not disturb him at night; we did inform him about the telegram in the morning. He smiled and didn't say anything. We felt humble. What was it? Was it telepathy, clairvoyance, or what? Or could he see that person dying, while in his meditation? Time passed and we left it at that. We thought that it could be just a coincidence. But what could one say when such incidents occurred?

Some years later, I was promoted to a higher post and simultaneously transferred to some other office. I was more jubilant about my transfer; for, I was really craving for a change! But as it happened my boss offered that he would promote me in the same organization immediately, should I like to stay. He gave me three days to decide. But I was keen to go! The decision was difficult.

I reached home late in the evening. I was off-colour. My father asked me what had happened. I narrated the whole story. He gave a deep pause and suggested that on the third day I should consult him before leaving for office. I was worried and baffled. I was so upset that I even forgot my father's advice.

The third day morning, when I was ready to leave for work, my father called out to me from his room. He said, "Well, you have to give your decision today." I kept quiet. He said in a commanding tone, "Please tell him that you would like to join the other department; and you will see he will relieve you after three days; do as you are told!" I nodded my head and left the room.

Strange thoughts came to my mind. My boss wanted me to stay. On the contrary, I was to say something which would displease him. To say the truth, I was not mustering courage to displease him. I was on the horns of a dilemma. At about 3 p.m., I was sent ...for. As soon as I entered the room, I found my boss in a good mood expecting that I should opt to stay on. This appeared to be natural in the circumstances. I was just about to opt for promotion but some unseen power seized me; I said that I would like to join the other department. He became suddenly serious; appeared annoyed and in a formal manner bade me to wait for six months. I left the room heart-broken. I cursed myself and cursed my father too. I was convinced that I would not only lose promotion for six months to come but at the same time I had caused my officer's displeasure. Did my father prevail upon me? This thought haunted me all the time till I reached home.

I was worried and angry. I narrated the outcome of my meeting to my father and told him that his advice was going to land me in trouble. He gave me the same usual smile and said, "Wait for the third day; do not lose faith." I left the room muttering some nonsense. Was this the result of my own foolishness or was I compelled to say so?

The third day came. In fact I did not expect any miracle to happen. But at about 2.30 p.m. I was sent for by my boss. I felt nervous and I entered the room with fear expecting something awful. When my officer raised my eyes, he said, "I have passed your orders and you go right now and join the new post." I left the room in great excitement. What was it? It couldn't be telepathy or clairvoyance. Was it that my father possessed some powers of influencing another person's will whom he had never seen or met? Did he prevail upon me to say what I never wanted to say? Or was it due to his prayer? I was simply baffled.

About 7 years ago, my wife got seriously ill early in the morning. Doctor was summoned immediately and he advised that she must be rushed to the hospital as her condition was grave. On reaching the hospital, my wife collapsed in the doctor's room and was immediately put on a stretcher to be sent to the ward. The emergency bell came. There was a commotion. All the doctors and nurses were running and she was laid on the bed in an unconscious state. I was advised to wait outside.

At about 6 p.m., the specialist called me in and shocked me by saying that I should immediately call my friends. I might have to take the dead body after an hour or so. I was dumb-founded; couldn't even ask as to what had happened. I told my father as to what had occurred. I was perturbed; the children started crying. My father stood still like a statue as if in a trance. I requested him to come along to the hospital. After a few moments, he smiled and said reassuringly, "What the hell are you talking? You will bring her home alive after five days. Return to the hospital and be there; go, make haste, I will not go with you. Someone has to be here to take care of the children."

A few days passed like this; my wife's life lying in balance. In the Occult World, my wife recovered and was discharged from the hospital on the fifth day as told. This experience simply astonished me. Was she destined to live? But on top of it, how could he know that she would be home on the fifth day?

Another incident is worth mentioning. I was once selected for a deputation post. My orders of postings were being delayed. Once some of my friends visited me on a Sunday: one of them had been promoted to a higher post recently. My father congratulated him and talked about my posting. My friend told him that it was important for the concerned official in the Ministry to issue the orders. My father gave a short pause and told him that the concerned official (about whom he had no knowledge) was also due for some rise. My friend, a senior officer, happened to know this particular officer. He told my father that the question of the concerned officer's promotion did not arise as he was too junior to get a raise. My father again gave the same sort of smile and said, "You people always count your rise in terms of money; sometimes an officer gets posted to a very wide post with enough powers where he is able to do much better and prove his worth." He added, "It is this that is going to happen. You can tell him if you happen to know him."

Strangely enough, after some time, the concerned officer was tipped for a different assignment. He at once rang up my friend and told him as to what had happened. He desired to see my father. My friend readily agreed and one day both of them visited us in the evening. My father, as usual, would smile and say nothing when we talked about such matters. He was by nature very unassuming and did not assume any airs. After a long discussion about some odd happenings of the day, my father addressed the concerned officer and said, "Mind you, you will not leave your present seat unless and until you sign the orders of deputation of my son which have been unduly delayed." The official told him that there were certain formalities to be completed and he would do his best to issue the orders early now in his own interest.

The matter of my deputation dragged on. The official concerned too was not getting relieved. One day in the morning he signed my orders. The same afternoon he received his own orders. This was the first time my father came inside after five days ordeal.

My father was no astrologer, or palmist. He would not even claim to be a saint either. He lived as any other human being. He was a learned man and all along his life devoted time in studying metaphysics, scriptures and was greatly fond of philosophical studies; his first love being yoga and meditation.

In early 1967, he had told me in the presence of a few close friends, that if December 1967 spared him, he would leave the earth after two years. He died in December 1969.
